I'm Noor Benny, a California native with a passion for delving into data and exploring the great outdoors. Growing up on the Monterey Peninsula, I developed a deep appreciation for nature and all its wonders. Whether it's hiking through the rugged trails or soaking in the tranquility of the beach, you'll often find me embracing the beauty of Northern California's landscapes.

Currently, I'm pursuing my studies in statistics and data science at UCLA, where I'm honing my analytical skills and delving into the fascinating world of data. My ultimate goal is to carve out a career path as a data analyst in the dynamic fields of media and marketing. I'm driven by the prospect of leveraging data-driven insights to optimize strategies and unlock new opportunities in the ever-evolving landscape of digital media.

What sets me apart is my diverse skill set, cultivated through hands-on experience in marketing gained from past internships and professional endeavors. I thrive on the challenge of analyzing complex datasets and translating them into actionable insights that drive growth and innovation.

Through this journey, I'm dedicated to continuous learning and growth, always seeking new avenues to expand my knowledge and make meaningful contributions to the world around me.
